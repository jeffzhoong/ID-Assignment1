# Your Project's Name

I have designed and built a responsive personal portfolio website, to present myself in the best light to get hired. I have separated this project into two main parts, a Personal Website and a Resume, which are both responsive.

Under my personal website, I have included a webiste header which branches out to 4 sections; Home, Resume, Projects and Contacts. Under Home section, I have included an 'About Me' page which summarises the basic details about myself, such as who I am, what I currently do and also added a 'View Resume' button which will bring the hirer to my Resume Website. Under the 'Projects' section, I showcase my portfolio of projects done so far and added links to view its code on GitHub and the website itself if needed. Lastly, under the 'Contact' section, I included the feature for hirers to contact me if needed. For my resume website, I have also included all the important details about myself; my educational history, work experience, outlined my professional skills and interests. Moreover, there are my personal contacts such as my LinkedIn, for hirers to view to know me better.

The reason why I created a separate Resume Website was for hirers to be able to view my skillsets and education etc. at a glance and need not scroll on my Personal Portfolio Website to know more about me. While the Resume Website provides all the personal information about myself, the Personal Portfolio Website mainly serves as a platform for hirers to view my projects and to contact me. I believe that my Websites have unique and captivating designs, with aesthetics logos, colours and fonts to attract hirer's attention.

## Design Process

The main purpose of my Personal Website is to attract hirers to hire me. With all my personal information, projects and skillsets layed out on my Personal Portfolio Website and Resume Website, hirers are able to view me in the best light and decide on whether they would want to hire me based on my qualifications.

As my Personal Portfolio Website & Resume Website is advocated to hirers to view, I have researched and took in consideration of what hirers would want to normally view on a personal website. As a hirer, one would want to see a hiree's qualification, education history, work experience, personal information and projects done to decide whether the hiree is qualified to be hired in the hirer's company. A hirer would also want the website to be minimilistic yet unique and simple so they can understand the content in the website simply and quickly. In addition, a hirer would want to contact the hiree if the hiree fits the qualifications to work at the hirers company.

When creating my wireframe to start of my project, I took into consideration of what hirers would want to see in a website, and came up with a rather simple design. Thereafter, I researched on colours that are appealing to the eye and visualised it in my wireframe; blue(for resume website) and yellow(for personal website). Initially, the design of my wireframe was rather simple, and once I started to implement css into the website, I improved the design of my website and updated my wireframe. I have included my wireframe, from Adobe XD in pdf format under 'resources' folder and here is the link to my wireframe, [Adobe XD](https://xd.adobe.com/view/64a1f722-1184-4a38-a6e7-dcc1a16884c2-31f2/).

   2. Click on 'Home, Resume, Projects, Contact' and verify that it send you to its respective sections on the website
   3. View the website on mobile
   4. Verify that a 'web hamburger icon' appears instead of 'Home, Resume, Projects, Contact' and when clicked, 'Home, Resume, Projects, Contact' will appear vertically, and verify that it send you to its respective sections on the website

Viewed on smaller screens:

- When viewed in mobile mode, the navgation bar will show a 'web hamburger icon' and when clicked on it, it will show 'Home, Resume, Projects, Contact' vertically.
- My picture under 'About Me' section will be gone as it covers too much space
